This tutorial assumes you're already familiar with HTML, CSS, JS, and npm. It also assumes you know what Tailwind is for.

## Local Setup

First, visit the <a href="https://github.com/simpledevio/tailwind-training-ground" target="_blank">Tailwind training ground repo</a>. Press the green **Code** button and click **Download ZIP**. Unzip the file and then open it in your editor. Then, run this command in the terminal to install the packages listed in `package.json`.

```bash
npm install
```

Then run this command to start the dev server.

```bash
npm run dev
```
This command converts `src/input.css` into `src/output.css`. It'll update the file every time you save. Use `Ctrl + C` to stop this process.

Open the `index.html` file in your browser. The web page should say **Hello World**. You can also use the Live Preview extension to open up `index.html` on localhost:3000.

In your editor, you'll see several files. However, for now you'll mainly be working in `src/input.css`.
